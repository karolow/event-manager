# Event Manager

A management tool to collect and process information on cultural events – from promotion to statistics and reporting.

### About

Organisations with over a dozen branches often experience a similar challenge – how to make the information flow more consistent to facilitate reporting and promotion of events?

To streamline this process and collect data for further analysis, we created a web application for employees and supervisors of cultural organisations.

It allows users to manage their organisation's profiles and publish data about events. Different authorisation levels make it possible to facilitate both project coordinators and officials responsible for the entire process.

In addition, we have launched a public API, thanks to which external partners, such as media or researchers, can easily access information on current events.
